## Live demo

http://sb-admin-2-angular.meteor.com

## Credits

This template site was forked from the Start Bootstrap SB Admin 2 template and adapted for Meteor and Angular.  Heavily based off the work done at [SB Admin 2 Angular](https://github.com/start-angular/sb-admin-angular).
For more information on the original see [Startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/).

## Features:

  * ECMA2015, Jade, and LESS (only slightly modified from the one provided by startbootstrap.com). The original is
    raw JavaScript and HTML.
  * Redirects and missing routes supported.
  * Only dependency is roughly 70 lines of JavaScript and 60 lines of CSS for metisMenu jQuery plugin. All of this code is included in this repository under plugins and loads correctly by Meteor.
  * Wired into Meteor's account system for user creation, login, and logout.

## Not done (yet?)

  * Splash Page
